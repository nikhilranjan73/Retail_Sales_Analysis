📊 Retail Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis

(SQL | Excel |Power BI| Business Analysis)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail store sales data to evaluate sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior.
The objective is to move beyond basic sales totals and identify what actually drives revenue and profit, and where the business is losing money despite decent sales.

This analysis is designed from a business decision-making perspective, not just data exploration.

🏪 Business Context

The retail store records daily sales transactions, including:

Order details

Product categories

Customer information

Order date and location

Despite having sufficient data, the business lacks actionable insights to:

Improve profitability

Optimize product strategy

Understand customer contribution

Identify underperforming areas

As a result, decisions are made based on intuition rather than data.

❓ Business Questions Addressed

Which product categories drive the highest revenue vs profit?

Are high-selling products actually profitable, or are they margin killers?

Which regions or locations underperform despite strong sales volume?

How much revenue is generated by repeat customers vs new customers?

What is the Average Order Value (AOV) and how does it vary across categories?

Which products and customers contribute the most value to the business?

📐 Key Metrics & Definitions

Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price

Profit = Revenue − Cost

Profit Margin = Profit / Revenue

Average Order Value (AOV) = Total Revenue / Total Orders

Customer Contribution % = Customer Revenue / Total Revenue

These metrics were used consistently to ensure accurate business interpretation.

🔍 Analysis Performed

Cleaned and prepared raw sales data for analysis

Calculated revenue, profit, margin, and AOV

Analyzed product-level and category-level performance

Evaluated customer contribution to total revenue

Compared sales volume vs profitability across regions

📈 Key Insights

A small percentage of products contribute a large share of total revenue.

Several high-selling products have low profit margins, indicating over-discounting or high costs.

Certain locations show high sales volume but weak profitability, pointing to operational inefficiencies.

Repeat customers generate higher Average Order Value (AOV) compared to new customers.

Focusing only on sales volume hides critical profit leakage.

💡 Business Recommendations

Prioritize high-margin products rather than only high-volume products.

Re-evaluate discount strategies for low-margin, high-selling items.

Improve operational efficiency in underperforming regions.

Design targeted strategies to retain repeat customers and increase their lifetime value.

📎 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how structured analysis and clearly defined KPIs can transform raw sales data into actionable business insights.
The focus is not just on what happened, but on why it happened and what should be done next.
